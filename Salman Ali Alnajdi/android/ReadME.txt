Hi 

Iam Salman Ali Alnajdi

I chose the Android Software development path for several reasons, the most important of which is:
      
       1. A passion for learing programming and I hope to become a professinal in order to teach my students.
       2. It is possible to change my job if i master programming.
       3. Create and desgin my own applications that related to my hobby(Auto mechanices).
       4. work as freelancer on my freetime.
